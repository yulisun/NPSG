# NPSG
Nonlocal Patch Similarity based Graph (NPSG) for heterogeneous remote sensing change detection

Code: NPSG - PR 2021

This is a test program for the NPSG. NPSG is based on the image self-similarity. 
The relationship between the target patch and its similar patches can be regarded 
as the structure of this target patch, which is quite well preserved across the different types
of imaging modality, then it can be used to build the relationship between heterogeneous images.

The computational time of NPSG is relatively long, to reduce the
computational complexity, we recommend using a larger opt.delt_s and
opt.delt_p.

Another suggestion is to use the INLPG algorithm we proposed
(https://github.com/yulisun/INLPG) or the IRG-McS algorithm (https://github.com/yulisun/IRG-McS).
